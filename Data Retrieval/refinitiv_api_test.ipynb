       "<p>Treads launched in May 2021 to simplify car ownership and has since expanded into 21 major United States markets with over 4,000 customers offering subscriptions for tires, oil changes, alignments and wiper blades as well as a full auto insurance marketplace. As the company expands its capabilities and size, Treads sought a solution where car owners could easily and independently verify their actual tire tread depth or the life left in their tires, leading to its partnership with Anyline and deploying the Anyline Tread Depth Scanner. This partnership expands its capabilities, further protects car owners from surprise expenses and lowers the cost of entry for owning and driving a vehicle.</p>\n",
